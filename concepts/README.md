## Why Philosophy Matters

Tools change rapidly. Principles endure.

Understanding the *why* behind AI-powered development helps you:
- Evaluate new tools as they emerge
- Adapt workflows to your context
- Make better decisions under uncertainty
- Teach others effectively

## Key Ideas

### Specification Before Code

Clear intent produces better outcomes. Writing specs forces you to think before coding and gives AI the context it needs to help effectively.

### AI as Collaborator

AI isn't replacing developers—it's changing what developers do. The most effective engineers use AI to handle implementation while focusing on architecture, requirements, and quality.

### Living Documentation

Specs and context files aren't just for AI—they create documentation as a byproduct. Keep them updated and they serve both humans and machines.

### Iterative Refinement

Perfect specs don't exist. Start with your best understanding, execute, learn, and refine. The PRD loop embraces this reality.
