# Contributing to Awesome AI Software Engineering

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This document outlines how to add resources and improve this collection.

## Resource Requirements

Before submitting a resource, ensure it meets these criteria:

### Must Have
- **Actively maintained** - Regular commits within the last 6 months
- **Documentation** - Clear README explaining what it does and how to use it
- **Unique value** - Offers something not already covered by existing entries
- **Relevant** - Directly related to AI-powered software engineering

### Nice to Have
- Open source with permissive license
- Active community (issues, discussions, PRs)
- Multiple contributors
- Used in production environments

## Entry Format

### For Tools and Projects

Use this table format:

```markdown
| [Name](https://github.com/org/repo) | Author/Org | Brief description (under 100 characters) |
```

**Guidelines:**
- Name should link to the primary repository or website
- Author is the GitHub org or primary maintainer
- Description should be concise and action-oriented
- Start descriptions with a verb when possible

**Good examples:**
- "Generate entire codebases from a single prompt"
- "AI pair programming in your terminal with git integration"
- "Framework for orchestrating role-playing autonomous agents"

**Avoid:**
- "A tool that helps you..." (redundant)
- "The best..." (subjective)
- Excessive technical jargon

### For Guides and Concepts

When contributing documentation:
- Use clear, accessible language
- Include practical examples
- Link to related resources
- Keep sections focused and scannable

## Pull Request Process

1. **Fork** the repository
2. **Create a branch** with a descriptive name
   - `add-tool-name` for new resources
   - `fix-description` for corrections
   - `update-section` for improvements
3. **Make your changes** following the format guidelines
4. **Test links** to ensure they work
5. **Submit PR** with a clear description of what you're adding and why

### PR Description Template

```markdown
## What
- Adding [resource name] to [category]

## Why
- Brief explanation of why this resource belongs here

## Checklist
- [ ] Resource is actively maintained
- [ ] Links are valid
- [ ] Description follows format guidelines
- [ ] Placed in appropriate category
```

## Category Suggestions

If you think a resource doesn't fit existing categories, you can propose a new one:

1. Open an issue first to discuss the new category
2. Explain what gap it fills
3. Suggest at least 3 resources that would fit
4. If approved, submit a PR with the new section

### Potential New Categories
- Testing frameworks for AI-generated code
- AI code review tools
- Prompt libraries and templates
- Benchmarks and evaluation tools

## Quality Standards

### For Code Examples
- Should be runnable without modification
- Include necessary imports/dependencies
- Add comments for non-obvious parts

### For Documentation
- Use proper markdown formatting
- Check spelling and grammar
- Ensure headers follow hierarchy
- Keep line lengths reasonable (< 100 chars)

## Questions?

- Open an issue for questions about contributions
- Check existing issues before creating new ones
- Be respectful and constructive in discussions
