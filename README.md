## Philosophy

AI-powered software engineering isn't about replacing developers—it's about amplifying their capabilities. The most effective approach combines:

1. **Specifications before code** - Clear intent leads to better outcomes
2. **AI as collaborator** - Leverage AI for execution while you focus on architecture
3. **Living documentation** - Keep context fresh and accessible
4. **Iterative refinement** - Build in feedback loops

Read more in our [Philosophy Guide](concepts/philosophy.md).

## Quick Start

**Step 1:** Choose your primary tool
- New to AI coding? Start with [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code) or [Cursor](https://cursor.sh)
- Want maximum control? Try [Aider](https://github.com/paul-gauthier/aider) or [OpenCode](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode)

**Step 2:** Adopt a spec-driven workflow
- Write a brief PRD before starting any feature
- Use the [PRD template](patterns/spec-templates/PRD.md.template) to structure your requirements

**Step 3:** Iterate and refine
- Review AI-generated code critically
- Build your prompt library for common patterns
- Track what works in your CONTEXT.md

See our full [Getting Started Guide](guides/getting-started.md).

## Methodologies

Workflows and approaches for AI-assisted development.

### PRD Loops

The PRD (Product Requirements Document) loop is a cyclic workflow:

1. **Specify** - Write clear requirements in a PRD
2. **Plan** - Let AI break down the work into tasks
3. **Execute** - AI implements while you review
4. **Refine** - Update the PRD based on learnings
5. **Repeat** - Continue until complete

### Spec-First Development

Start every feature with a specification:
- Forces clarity of thought before coding
- Gives AI maximum context to work with
- Creates documentation as a byproduct
- Enables better code review

### Agent Swarms

Use multiple specialized agents for complex projects:
- **Architect Agent** - Designs system structure
- **Developer Agent** - Writes implementation code
- **Reviewer Agent** - Checks code quality
- **Tester Agent** - Creates and runs tests

See our [Spec-Driven Development Guide](guides/spec-driven-development.md) for details.
